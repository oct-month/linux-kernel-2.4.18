	Removed the cut and paste bug description from the BUGS file.  (Jim)
	
2001-10-14 Sunday 15:28  jim

	Part two of the selection.c patch for 2.2.  This process sure was fun!  (Jim)
	
2001-10-14 Sunday 15:21  jim

	Just adding the new patch file for selection.c in the diff-v24 patch
	directory. (kirk)
	
2001-10-14 Sunday 14:42  kirk

	Changed selection.c to test if call is coming from userspace or kernel
	space and using GFP_ATOMIC if it is being called from kernel-space.
	This works around kmalloc not returning and hanging the system in
	set_selection for the block and paste function of speakup. (Jim)
	
2001-10-12 Friday 12:10  jim

	speakup.c:
	    Removed statements which were appending 0x00 to buffers to be spoken
	    from functions say_curr_line and say_line_from_to.
	
	    Inspected and modified all spkup_write() calls to be consistent,
	    that is, end in \n and count is correct.
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-10-09 Tuesday 08:34  kirk

	Updated the BUGS and Todo list to reflect current speakup
	states. (kirk)

		unsigned short *arg;
		static char *buf = "speakup_cut: set_selection failed: ";
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-10-07 Sunday 17:11  jim

	Put speakup_dectlk.c back to its original state.  Sorry about that!
	
	Also added a clear_selection() call to speakup.c when hitting the "mark"
	    key to remove (if any) hi-lighting of a previous mark/cut from the screen.
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-10-05 Friday 09:14  kirk

	Checking in a slight change to speakupmap.map to uncomment alt-keypad
	five to allow ascii five for extended character sets. (kirk)
	
2001-10-02 Tuesday 12:34  kirk

	Modified installation and readme files for the version 1.0 release in
	linux/Documentation/speakup. (kirk)
	
2001-10-02 Tuesday 11:00  kirk

	Start of the check-ins for the official speakup v-1.00 release.
	Modified checkin to change cvsversion format.  Modified install to
	remove reference to touching speakupmap.map.  Modified speakup.c to
	reflect version now moved to v-1.00. (kirk)
	
2001-10-02 Tuesday 01:18  jim

	Modified the way that cut/paste variables are stored.  No longer in spk_t
	structure but stand-alone (one per speakup rather than one per console).
	
	speakup.c:
	    eliminated unsigned short mode = 0; /* char-by-char selection */
	    by assigning it directly.
	
	    Added globals
		char mark_cut_flag;
		unsigned short mark_x, mark_y;
	
	/usr/include/linux/include/linux/speakup.h:
	    removed mark_x and mark_y from the spk_t structure and the associated
	    defines.
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-09-17 Monday 19:58  jim

	speakup.c:
	    Added:
		#define Mark_Cut_Bit 0x04
		#define Mark_Cut_Bit_Mask 0xFB
	
	    Changed from using bit 2 of spk_shut_up to bit 2 of spk_sound to
	    indicate mark/cut state.
	
	    Removed statement that was assigning 2 to second byte of first short
	    in args array.
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-09-14 Friday 15:43  kirk

	Removed the blank line at the bottom of drivers/char/Makefile which I
	must have dreamed I removed in the last log.  (kirk)
	
2001-09-14 Friday 15:28  kirk

2001-09-13 Thursday 23:13  jim

	diff-v2[24]/^usr^src^linux^Documentation^speakup^DefaultKeyAssignments.copy:
	    Added:
		KeyPad-/		Mark and Cut screen region.
		InsKeyPad-/		Paste screen region into any console.
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-09-13 Thursday 21:41  jim

	Wrote mark/cut/paste feature.
	
	    Usage:
		1.  Move reading cursor to one end of the block of text you wish to cut
		2.  Press the mark/cut key.  You should hear "mark".
		3.  Move reading cursor to other end of block of text to be cut.
		4.  Press the mark/cut key.  You should hear "cut".
		5.  The cut buffer is now saved.
		6.  Move to a program in any console where you wish to copy the cut buffer.
		7.  Press the paste key.  You should hear "paste" and text from
		    the cut buffer will be output just as if you had entered it
		    at the keyboard.
	
	    Note:  Trailing whitespace is stripped and newlines added where appropriate.
	
	speakup.c:
	    Added two new functions; speakup_cut() and speakup_paste()
	
	speakupmap.map:
	    Modified default keymap so that keypad divide toggles mark/cut and
	    insert-keypad divide is paste.
	
	/usr/src/linux/include/linux/speakup.h:

		#define spk_my speakup_console[currcons]->mark_y
		#define SPEAKUP_CUT 0x27
		#define SPEAKUP_PASTE 0x28
	    Added two new prototypes:
		extern void speakup_cut(unsigned int, struct tty_struct *);
		extern void speakup_paste(struct tty_struct *);
	
	/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/keyboard.c:
	    In function do_spkup():
		Added case blocks for SPEAKUP_CUT and SPEAKUP_PASTE.
	
	/usr/src/linux/include/linux/keyboard.h:
	    Added:
		#define K_SPEAKUP_CUT K(KT_SPKUP,SPEAKUP_CUT)
		#define K_SPEAKUP_PASTE K(KT_SPKUP,SPEAKUP_PASTE)
	    and modified: (was 27)
		#define NR_SPKUP	0x29
	
	Also modified patch/copy files below in both diff-v22 and diff-v24 directories.

2001-09-08 Saturday 22:22  kirk

	Re-implementing the alpha patch for kernels 2.4.x which somehow keeps
	getting lost.  I also removed the bottom three lines of the checkout
	script which are not needed anymore because we include a
	speakupmap.c. (Kirk)
	
2001-08-30 Thursday 17:25  kirk

	Modified drivers/char/Makefile to work with the new speakupmap.c
	changes to 2.4.x.  These changes include a portion of Shane's patch as
	well as other rewrites by me. (kirk)
	
2001-08-30 Thursday 16:17  kirk

	Modified drivers/char/Makefile and speakup/Makefile to accomodate the
	new 2.4.9ac3 Makefile changes.  This will also include a new
	speakupmap.c moving towards Shane's Makefile patches for the 2.2.x
	kernels, not included yet. (kirk)
	
2001-08-29 Wednesday 21:26  kirk

	Just adding new patch against linux/init/main.c to cvs. (kirk)
	
2001-08-29 Wednesday 21:23  kirk

	Rewrote speakup_init() to call a function speakup_register_devsynth()
	which gets called from do_basic_setup in init/main.c.  We need to do
	this so that miscdevice will get called after the mm has been set up.
	This should allow devfs to work with speakup.  (kirk)
	
2001-08-26 Sunday 13:54  kirk

	Removed an old comment line from console.c which prevent clean
	patching against 2.4.8ac11. (kirk)

2001-07-31 Tuesday 19:07  jim

	speakup_ltlk.c: appended \x20 to flush string of \x18 for litetalk driver.
	This seems to fix the bug that was causing first chars to be dropped by
	the double lt and litetalk synths for some users.  (Jim Danley)
	
2001-07-26 Thursday 20:12  kirk

	A few small clean ups trying to get 2.4.7 to work. (Kirk)

	functions are available in raw mode for v-2.4.x kernels. (Kirk)
	
2001-03-17 Saturday 15:40  jim

	speakup.c:
	Added silent feature.
	The print screen key kills and revives speakup.  Sending specific values to
	/proc/speakup/silent now allows the same control without having to press a key.
	Valid settings are 0 through 3.
	0 and 2 turn on speakup if not already alive.
	1 and 3 turn off speakup if not already killed.
	0 and 1 announce the changes as the print screen key does,
	2 and 3 act silently.
	(Jim Danley)
	
2001-03-17 Saturday 08:45  jim

	speakup.c and symbols.h:
	Added bell position feature.
	When a letter is typed in column bell_pos, console beeps.

	(Gene Collins)
	
2001-03-13 Tuesday 14:40  jim

	speakup.c:
	Found and fixed a couple of places where synth_write() was writing len of
	string plus 1 which caused a NULL to be sent to the synth which causes
	problems for the Doubletalk LT.
	
	speakup.c and keyboard.c for 2.2 and 2.4
	Corrected the length parameter on several spkup_write() statements which
	were also sending unnecessary NULLs.
	
	Corrected spelling of /proc/speakup/transport directory.  (Jim Danley)
	
2001-02-28 Wednesday 10:55  kirk

	Removing the make menuconfig patches for checklist.c and menubox.c

	Made changes to 2.4.0 to move uart initialization code into
	speakup_drvcommon.c and modified speakup_dectlk.c to use that
	change. (Kirk)
	
2001-01-28 Sunday 00:26  jim

	Modified the serprobe() function in the Accent SA driver.
	This should allow the Accent SA to start talking from a cold boot with
	no help from the lilo serial= or speakup_ser= options.
	Ran speakup_acntsa.c through Lindent.
	Bumped speakup_acntsa.c version number.  (Jim Danley)
	
2001-01-27 Saturday 23:26  jim

	Modified the serprobe() function in the Dectalk Express driver.
	My Dectalk Express now starts talking just fine from a cold boot with
	no help from the lilo serial= or speakup_ser= options.

	Bumped Dectalk Express driver version number.  (Jim Danley)
	
2001-01-25 Thursday 17:58  jim

	Worked on the write handler for /proc/speakup/synth.
	It error-checks new_synth_name, prints out msg if synth selected is
	already in use, looks for new_synth_name in list of synths compiled into
	kernel, and prepares to switch to new synth.
	Ran speakup.c through Lindent and cleaned up some comments.  (Jim Danley)
	
2001-01-24 Wednesday 22:59  jim

	
	Modified speakup_drvcommon.c so that those synth-specific /proc file

	to the /proc file entries for those settings that accept a range of
	values that includes alpha chars.
	The value is forced to lower case before any comparisons.
	Modified the synth driver range parameters to accept only lower case as follows:
	rate in both speakup_acntpc.c and speakup_acntsa.c,
	pitch and volume in speakup_apolo.c,

2001-01-04 Thursday 12:11  kirk

	Starting major changes for merging into the kernel source tree.  Files
	updated are console.c speakup.c speakup.h and vt.c.  I have built a
	new set of functions to interact with the kernel which will be speakup
	functions if speakup is configured in and null stubs if speakup is not
	configured in.  So far they include: speakup_allocate(), speakup_bs(),
