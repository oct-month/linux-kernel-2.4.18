This is the driver for the Margi/Billionton MPEG decoder PC-Card.
It is still in a beta state and may cause problems with your system.

INSTALLING 
----------
0) From now on you will need a 2.4.x kernel to make everything work

1) Install David Hinds` PCMCIA Card Services package. The current 
   version is at http://pcmcia.sourceforge.org/.
   This driver is known to work under versions 3.1.25 and later. Earlier 
   version may work too.
 
   % tar zxvf pcmcia-cs-3.1.25.tar.gz

2) Enter the pcmcia directory and unpack the margi driver.
   
   % cd pcmcia-cs-3.1.25
   % tar zxvf margi_cs-0.5.tar.gz
   
3) In the pcmcia main directory:

   % make config
   % make all
   # make install


The files for the margi are in margi2. (The name has historical reasons.)

ATTENTION You now need video4linux support in the kernel.
You can now use /dev/video for playback.


Using the driver
----------------
The driver registers a character device with major number 162. You can
cat an MPEG2 program stream into that device. 
If the device doesn`t exist (usually it`s /dev/raw) just 
   % mknod -m 0666 /dev/margi char 200 0
Than you 
   % cat nicempg2.vob > /dev/margi
or 
   % cat nicempg.mpg > /dev/margi

At the moment we do not recognize the audio format of the MPEG1/2, so
MPEG audio is hard-coded as default. You can change that in cvdv.c in the
Prepare() routine, or by using the ioctl Decoder_Set_Audiotype, e.g.:

#include "cvdvext.h"

main()
{
        struct decodercmd decmd;

	decmd.param1=audio_AC3;
	decmd.cmd=Decoder_Set_Audiotype;
        DecoderCommand(device,decmd);
...

}

In the directory testsuite are some example programs for using the driver.
I hope they are more or less self explanatory. Just use the --help option.


If you want the latest drivers apart from the release versions, use
the public CVS at linuxtv.org : http://linuxtv.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/


ZV-support
----------

You will faind patches for ZV support in the zv-diffs directory. The
ones with the version number for pcmcia-cs ar for the respective
versions of this package. The rest is for graphics chips or sound
chips, like the patches for the Neomagic graphics chip and YMF sound
chip submitted by Shigehiro Nomura. 

There now three module parameters that are all set to 1 (=on) but can
be set to off in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
They are : "svhs" for switching the svhs output DAC on or off (0 or 1).
           "composite" for switching the composite output DAC on or off.
           "use_zv" for enabling zv output if you compiled with the
           -DUSE_ZV setting in margi_cs.mk.

E.g. 
module "margi_cs" opts "use_zv=0" 
turns off zv output.
or 
module "margi_cs" opts "composite=0 svhs=0"
turns off the external outputs.
