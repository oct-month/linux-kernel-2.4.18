* Removed serial console code
* Removed support for kernels < 2.4 (2.2.18+ to be added back later)
* resolve some operating system abstractions
* fix macros (like DEBUG() etc) to be statement-like
* put all .c files into 1 file for better searchability, and later split
  them again (I'm not happy with the resulting split yet though, I might go
  back to the original split)
* use 64 bit addresses for DMA everywhere, even on x86
* get rid of virt_to_bus for physical addresses
* consistent use of struct scsi_qla_host instead of several aliases
* use proper PCI API of the 2.4 kernel
* remove caddr_t in most places as that's illegal in the kernel
* fix bufferoverflow from the /proc file
* attempt to add 2100 support back
* check return codes of put_user() and get_user()
* fix bug in dpc thread wrt io_request_lock use
* add PCI device ID for use by installer tools
* fix missed wakups by the dpc thread
* inform the kernel that the device is capable of large (512
  sectors) requests
* clean up handling of the done_queue, retry_queue, failover_queue
  and lun queue to use linux lists and to have a consistent, per ha, 
  spinlock for protecting the list (needed for later removal of
  io_request_lock usage)
* don't disable/reenable interrupts on the device in the hard irq handler
* fix stack overflow that caused oopses and/or memory corruption
* fix using stack variables to register IO ports and other resources
  (and bufferoverflow in the same code)
* fix sleeping with spinlock held
